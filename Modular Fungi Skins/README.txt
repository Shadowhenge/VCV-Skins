These will replace the existing original Modular Fungi
blank plates with various other ones.  They work slightly different, however.

1) Make a backup copy of your Modular Fungi /res directory.
2) Copy the blank plates from the skin pack folder directly 
into the existing /res folder, overwriting the files.

The reason for this is that there are two skin sets in the modular fungi module
This one only overwrites the original, and not the newer zen set.

I hope to create my own module for this at some point with several blank plate sets
